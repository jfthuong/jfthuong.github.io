:function: analyze_folder

== Introduction

This mini project for Python will help practice:

* Listing files
* Getting information on file
* Writing in files
* Creating a function

Ideally, this can be done with `pathlib` module which will make things easier.

You can learn about pathlib from the official documentation:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

== Goal of project

=== Purpose of the function

The purpose of this project is to create a function `{function}` that will:

* list all files in a folder (and its subfolder)
* create a CSV file listing all files with their name, extension, and size


Once the CSV file is generated, the function `{function}` shall print the following message:

    Successfully listed nnn files and printed analysis in xxx.csv

Where `nnn` is the number of files found and `xxx.csv` is the name of generated file

An example of CSV file would be the following:

.my_folder.csv
[source, csv]
Path,Extension,Size
data/some_text.txt,.txt,1.23 KB
crazy_program.py,.py,3.14 GB

=== Arguments of the function

The function `{function}` shall have 2 arguments:

1. `folder`: A string with the path of the directory to analyze
2. `csv_path`: A string with the path of the CSV file to create, with a default value of `"analyze_folder.csv"`


== How to start?

If you use `pathlib`, then you will need to do the following:

1. At the top of your notebook / program, load `Path` from the module: `from pathlib import Path`

2. Inside your function, create a `Path` for your directory: `path = Path(folder)`

3. Open the CSV file to write in it. Write a first line with the headers: +
+
    Path,Extension,Size

4. Do a loop for each of the files in the directory: you can check https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/#display-a-directory-tree[this tutorial]

5. For each file:
  * Get the extension the file
  * Get the size of the file
  * Write a line with path, extension, and size separated by a comma


== TIPS

=== Friendly display of size

When getting the size of a file in Python, it is usually in bytes.
To convert it to a more friendly format, you can use the following function that transform the size in bytes (integer) to a friendly size (as a string):

```
def convert_size(size):
    """Convert a size in bytes (as integer) to a size with unit (as a string)"""
    unit = "B"
    # Reminder: 1 KB = 1024 B, and 1 MB = 1024 KB, ...
    for letter in "KMG":
        if size > 1024:
            size /= 1024
            unit = f"{letter}B"

    # We want to keep 2 digits after floating point
    # because it is a good balance and precision and concision
    return f"{size:0.2f} {unit}"
```

For example, `convert_size(2000)` will return `"1.95 KB"`.

=== But how to get the size of a file?

You can use `pathlib` and use code here:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.stat

```
>>> p = Path('setup.py')
>>> p.stat().st_mode
33277
```

Note that if you already have a path (like for example when you have done a loop with `rglob`), then you don't need to do `Path(...)` again.

=== Why do I need to first open the CSV file?

You could actually get a huge string with all the information about the files that you will put later in the CSV file.

The only problem with that is that for a huge number of files (like several thousands), the string will start to be big.

Therefore, it is much simpler to write one line at a time, each time we have found a file.

=== Checking that it works

Call your function with a directory that contains multiple files of different sizes, like your "Downloads" folder, or "My Documents".

The CSV file can be opened directly in Microsoft Excel.

Cheers
